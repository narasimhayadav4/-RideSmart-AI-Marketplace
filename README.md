# 🚀 RideSmart-AI-Marketplace

## 📌 Problem Statement  
**Chosen Problem:** HACXPB003 – Build a two-wheeler marketplace web app  

Two-wheeler buying and selling today is fragmented, with buyers overwhelmed by choices and lack of personalization, while dealers struggle with inventory and pricing. Existing platforms act primarily as listing portals without intelligent decision support or transparent pricing.

## 💡 Proposal & Prototype Plan  

**RideSmart-AI-Marketplace** is a web platform where users can **discover, compare, and transact on bikes, scooters, and EVs**.  
The prototype integrates both **mandatory marketplace features** and **AI-powered enhancements**.  

**Plan of Action:**  
- Build the **frontend** with React.js for a responsive, user-friendly interface.  
- Implement the **backend** with Node.js/Express for listings, search, bookings, and dealer dashboards.  
- Use **PostgreSQL** for structured data (vehicles, users) and **MongoDB** for semi-structured data (inventory, logs).  
- Develop **AI microservices**:  
  - Used Bike Price Estimator (regression model – XGBoost/Random Forest).  
  - Recommendation Engine (hybrid filtering for personalized suggestions).  
- Deploy using **AWS EC2/Heroku for backend & AI**, **Vercel/Netlify for frontend**, and **AWS RDS/MongoDB Atlas for databases**.
